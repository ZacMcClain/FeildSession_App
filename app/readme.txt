Team 01

Our latest version of our Field Session App is up on Luna under the 'fieldSessionApp' folder.
To start using our app, login as one of the users in the Students file or as an admin using "admin@mines.edu" as the email and "12345678" as the CWID.
As a non-admin user, go to "Your Profile" to set/edit your project preferences and teammate preferences. 
You can also go to "My Team" to see the team that you have been assigned to. 
As an admin user, go to the "Admin View" page to see a list of all the projects, students, and submitted preferences. 
Also on the "Admin View" page, you can use the algorithm to generate teams using the Generate Teams button near the top of the page.
After you generate teams, you are automatically taken to the "All Teams" page where all the teams are displayed. 
The Teams are displayed on a table where each row has a project name and a list of user ids that have been assigned to that project. 
Id's that are -1 do not correspond to a person - pretend that those cells are blank.
